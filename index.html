  A car or automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people instead of goods.[1][2]

  The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.[3][4][5] Cars became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[citation needed] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[6] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.

  The initials SUV stand for sports
  utility vehicle. Brayleys explains
  more fully: â€œAn SUV is a car with a
  body shape that's characterised by
  big wheels and increased clearance
  height, with chunky, sporty styling.
  "The SUV generally has a rugged
  appearance that inspires fun and
  adventure.
  
  suv is automotive jargon that
  stands for Sports Utility Vehicle. It
  refers to a type of car that sits high
  up, off the ground, and often has four.
  wheel drive and sturdy styling. An
  SUV is also typically tall with lots of
  interior space and is generally built
  with mechanical parts that are
  specially designed for rugged use
